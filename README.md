## Description 

This is a full stack MERN application where a user is able to list their services they wish to sell to other users. A user is able to book the service they desire with a comment. I used a little bit of the template set by the Deep Thoughts application (github.com/jsnbdrx/deep-thoughts) as provided by the Boot Camp class materials.
